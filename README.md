# EVote

This is a project that uses BlockChain technology mixed with stack development to make : 
1. A digital voting system accesible on phone
2. A source to create and sign petitions
3. A digital contract medium

All for the IIIT Hyderabad community. This is intented to be a project to participate in the 23 May Hackathon organised by the E-Cell IIIT Hyderabad.

## Motivation

### E-voting System

The block chain based solution to voting is a long discussed solution to the problem of Going to a voting booth. In our first year at IIIT, we notice that to avoid inconvenience to voters, a large time gap is given to vote, that might lead to wastage of time, without guranteeing optimal convenience to the voters. Thus to save both time and effort, this is a good solution.

### E-Petitions

IIIT community is often faced with problems, that require attention of authorities. But for this, a large group should be in agreement. This is hard for it requires a MP, and multiple mails and posts to the student community. Why not make a college petitions page that can be used to make and sign petitions, or to browse the petitions they agree to.


## Installation
